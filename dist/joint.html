          <h2>How to Add a New Joint Member</h2>
          <p>
            Welcome to the New Member Registration Guide. This guide will help you register a
            <strong>Joint Member</strong> in the system. Follow each step carefully to complete the
            registration successfully.
          </p>
          <p>
            The process is similar to the Single Member registration but includes some specific
            fields for joint accounts.

        <section id="joint-intro">
          <h2>1. Overview of Joint Member Registration</h2>
          <p>
            Joint members share ownership of the same account. All key details must be captured
            correctly for each party so that instructions and mandates are clear and compliant.
          </p>
