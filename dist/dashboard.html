              The <strong>Transactions</strong> section is where all money movements are handled. Here you can make
              withdrawals, switch between your different accounts, and transfer funds from one account to another.
            </p>
            <p>
              It gives you a clear view of how money is coming in and going out of your accounts, helping both

          <div class="accordion-body">
            <p>
              The <strong>Reports</strong> section provides a summary of key information about clients and agents.
              It brings together important data in one place so that you can quickly review client activity, agent
              performance, and other high-level trends that support monitoring and decision-making.
            </p>
            <p>
              Unit Master records purchases, redemptions and computes the fund value after fees so that the reports
              always reflect accurate and up-to-date positions.

            <p>
              The <strong>Statements</strong> section gives you a detailed record of account activity over a selected
              period. It shows the amounts deposited, the funds invested, and the interest earned.
            </p>
            <p>
              This helps clients track how their money is growing and verify all movements on their accounts, making
              audits and client queries easier to handle.

              <strong>Fund expenses</strong> are accrued daily and reduce the daily fund value. Typical expenses
              include management fee, trust fee, and custody fee.
            </p>
            <p>
              These costs are calculated on a daily basis and usually deducted monthly from the fund, ensuring that
              valuations, NAVs and client statements correctly reflect net performance after fees.
