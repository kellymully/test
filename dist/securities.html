          <p>
            <strong>Securities / funds</strong> is a collective investment scheme where money from many
            investors is pooled together to purchase short term, low risk and highly liquid
            debt instruments.
          </p>

          <p>
            A professional fund manager invests this pooled money in assets like
            treasury bills, commercial paper and fixed deposits, and the returns are
            distributed to the investors, minus a management fee.
          </p>

          <p>
            This structure provides investors with a way to earn a return on their savings while still
            having easy access to their cash.
